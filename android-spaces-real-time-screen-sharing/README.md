# Mux Spaces Android SDK Example

This is an Android app demonstrating using the Spaces SDK to add real-time sharing of your screen to your app. It is the same code as developed in the Getting Started guide [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/real-time-screensharing-for-android)

## Running the example

It is strongly recommended to follow the Getting Started guide [here](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/real-time-screensharing-for-android) and to run on actual non-emulated devices.

As mentioned in the guide, you will need to replace `final String jwt = "YOUR JWT";` in MainActivity with your appropriate Mux JWT in order to run this example. For production use the JWT should be retrieved from a server at runtime. Follow these guides to learn more about [Creating a Space](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/build-real-time-video-experiences#1-create-a-space) and [Signing JWTs](https://docs.mux.com/guides/video/build-real-time-video-experiences#2-sign-a-jwt).
